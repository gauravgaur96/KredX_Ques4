Certainly! Below is a simplified example of how you might implement the described HTTP server backend with REST APIs using Java and the Spring Boot framework. This example uses an in-memory data structure to store user information.

Setup:

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.
Create a new Spring Boot project or add the required dependencies to your existing project.


The UserData class represents user information.
The TransactionData class represents transaction information.
The BCrypt class is used for password hashing.
Dependency:
Add the following dependency in your pom.xml for password hashing:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mindrot</groupId>
    <artifactId>jbcrypt</artifactId>
    <version>0.4</version>
</dependency>

Make sure to install it by running:
mvn install

Note:
This is a basic example, and in a production environment, you should use a real database for storing user and transaction information.
You might also want to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user sessions.
This is a starting point, and you can build upon it based on your specific requirements and security considerations.
